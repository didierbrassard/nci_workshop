# National Cancer Institute (NCI) methods workshop

This workshop is an introduction to random measurement errors in nutrition research. While it is obvious that a systematic error (difference) between the “true” value and its measurement can be a problem, the impact of random errors is often more subtle. However, in many cases, random errors can be as problematic as systematic errors if they are ignored.

Before diving into measurement error correction methods, I recommend two introduction blog posts on the topic: *[‘Statistical concept you should know’: random and systematic measurement errors](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2022/11/blog-post-6/)* and *[Impact of random errors: two nutrition examples](https://didierbrassard.github.io/posts/2022/11/blog-post-7/)*. Useful reference includes *Using Short-Term Dietary Intake Data to Address Research Questions Related to Usual Dietary Intake among Populations and Subpopulations: Assumptions, Statistical Techniques, and Considerations* by [Kirkpatrick et al. (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35283362/) as well as the *STRATOS guidance document on measurement error and misclassification of variables in observational epidemiology: Part 1-Basic theory and simple methods of adjustment* by [Keogh et al. (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32246539/)

## NCI univariate method, distribution

SAS codes (01, 02, ... 04) are provided as an introduction to basic aspects of random measurement errors and application of the NCI univariate method to generate a distribution of usual dietary intakes.

A companion presentation is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VKxCEDkiGSCbAYVioob-s4krjDJut4uT/view?usp=sharing).

The original NCI macros and further examples are available on the [Biometry Research Group's *Software for Measurement Error in Nutrition Research* website](https://prevention.cancer.gov/research-groups/biometry/measurement-error-impact/software-measurement-error)
